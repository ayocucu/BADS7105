# Customer Segmentation
From supermarket dataset, I have divided customer into 2 group, one-visit customer and re-visit customer.<br />
For this study, I am focusing on re-visit customer. <br />
### EDA
First, I have done the heatmap plot to see correlation between variables and decide what variable can be droped out.<bt />
#### Choosen variables :
!AVG_MONTHLY_SPEND<bt />
!AVG_MONTHLY_VISIT<bt />
!DUR_SINCE_FIRST_PURCH<bt />
!DUR_SINCE_LAST_PURCH<bt />
!AVG_TICKET_SIZE_BASKET_FRESH<bt />
!AVG_TICKET_SIZE_BASKET_GROCERY<bt />
!AVG_TICKET_SIZE_BASKET_MIXED'<bt />

### Choosing K-Mean
Then, do k-mean to find how many cluster should be use for classifying re-visit customer. I choose K=5.<bt />
